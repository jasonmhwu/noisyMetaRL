    "## How do humans achieve planning and reasoning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my leisure time, I play a lot of brain teasers. A quick online search will reveal countless of these games, and you can always find completely new games or those that share some rules that you have encountered previously. However different they are, one thing these games have in common is that with a quick read of the rules or a simple tutorial, most humans can have a good grasp of them and beat simple levels with near-perfect strategies. How do we do that, and can we build artificial intelligence (AI) agents to learn like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a rough understanding of what properties we want in our intelligent agent, let’s walk through a really simple game and think about the thought processes of a typical human player. In a basic “Guess A Number” game, the agent is given a range of numbers (e.g. from 1 to 100); in each trial, the agent chooses a number, gets told whether he should go higher or lower, and this process repeats until he selects the correct number. Here are some amazing properties that lead to the insights a human player would have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Can form the right hypothesis space**: The player should figure out that he doesn’t have to check each number to find the answer. Each guess he makes may eliminate multiple candidate numbers, so he should prefer this strategy to the first and exhaustive search one. Furthermore, the range of possible numbers is always between the largest “higher” guess and the smallest “lower” guess, so only two numbers are necessary to keep track of the current “hypothesis\". \n",
    "2. **Can store only the relevant information in memory**: The player should be able to keep track of the current hypothesis while avoiding irrelevant previous trials from interference.\n",
    "3. **Can form a near-optimal strategy by eliminating as many hypotheses as possible**: The player should figure out that the number in the middle of the range is always the best guess, as the feedback for this number can narrow the range down by half. \n",
    "\n",
    "While I use brain teasers as motivation, most of the human reasoning and planning behaviors also fit into this framework, and these abilities are the cornerstones of our intelligent behavior. More importantly, humans can reason with these abilities and develop strategies with very little experience with the game (i.e. **learn in a few-shot manner**), and they can easily deploy the same strategy to other games with a different range of numbers (i.e. **flexible task transfer**). It is therefore desirable to build an intelligent agent that behaves in similar ways and possesses all of these properties."
