    "# Test a meta-reinforcement learning model (A2C) on an associative learning task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I want to explore the power of a simple meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) model on simple associative learning tasks. This is the second post on my journey to understand meta-RL models and hopefully tweak them to behave like humans; and you can check out my overall project proposal here (TODO: hyperlink). This post assumes that you have basic knowledge on reinforcement learning (RL), and you can check out these awesome resources to get more resources (TODO)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is meta-reinforcement learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"meta\" confused me for a long time, so let's understand \"meta-learning\" in a clearer term: **learning to learn**. Imagine the traditional way we train a RL model to play the Pong game. For example, we can decide to pick the DQN algorithm, specify the number of layers and units in the Q-network, and finally choose our favorite loss function and optimizer. We may get lucky this time and the model plays Pong well, but this combination of choices may not work for the GO game, and we need to start from scratch and test numerous other algorithms. What if we can train a model to *learn the best learning algorithm for the task*? Wouldn't it be wonderful if we have such a model that can figure out the best way to learn in the current task setting? This is the essence of meta-RL models: **find the best learning aglorithm for the task with reinforcement learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promising future for meta-RL models\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-RL models TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should we test the model on associative learning tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Associative learning tasks are pretty common in the cognitive science field but not so much in computer science, but in our context they are simple multi-armed bandit tasks. You might think that multi-armed bandit task is one of the most basic problems in RL and countless algorithms are already built to solve it near-optimally, why bother testing it? Well, here are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Most of RL algorithms have built-in memory one way or another, but meta-RL algorithms don't*. Traditional models keep information of rewarding state-action pairs in Q-tables or value networks, so the way they utilize these memory resources are designed by the human researchers. On the other hand, the learning algorithms learned by meta-RL models are complete black boxes; researchers only specifies the number of memory units that the learning algorithm can use, and how these memory units are used is totally up to the algorithm. **By testing the meta-RL algorithm on associative learning tasks, we hope to understand how they utilize the given memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *While researchers can easily expand the memory resources in RL algorithms, you can't do the same things to humans.* Humans have very limited memory resources, and their performance fell short even in simple associative learning tasks as the number of state-action pairs increases. However, humans seem to recognize this limit and they can act in a near-optimal fashion under this constraint. **It is therefore intriguing to see whether the learning algorithm learned by the meta-RL model can show similar behavior under limited memory resources.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly go through the procedure of the associative learning task. As shown in Fig. 1, the model was trained on multiple associative learning blocks which have either 3 or 6 objects. At the start of each block, each object will be randomly associated with one of the three buttons. For each trial within each block, the model observes one stimulus (one-hot encoded in the experiment), presses one of the three action buttons, and finally gets feedback on whether the object-action pair is correct or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will train an iconic meta-RL model, an A2C algorithm with 20 LSTM units, on 20 million trials. We will compare the behavior between human participants and the trained meta-RL model. "
